<h3>Hey everyone ðŸ‘‹ I am Kyrylo Lvov</h3>
<p>
First and foremost, I enjoy coding! Ever since I wrote my first webpage, I have been obsessed with the idea of using software in order to solve real life problems. Software engineering is a never-ending puzzle that I am absolutely engaged in solving. I truly believe in the power of programming as an improvement to the lives of people all around the world.

Even when I finish my work, I always tend to continue coding and learning something new on my own. Most recently I have started learning ReactJs. In my spare time I play violin and I find a beautiful crossover between software and music. Both pursue challenges in many aspects of our mind: problem solving, creativity, organization and so on. This is what keeps me up at night, a never ending thirst to create gorgeous and powerful things and share them with the world!
