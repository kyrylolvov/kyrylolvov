<h3>Hey everyone ðŸ‘‹ I am Kyrylo Lvov</h3>
<p>
First and foremost, I enjoy coding! Ever since I wrote my first webpage, I have been obsessed with the idea of using software in order to solve real life problems. Software engineering is a never-ending puzzle that I am absolutely engaged in solving. I truly believe in the power of programming as an improvement to the lives of people all around the world.

For my first freelance contract, I was given the opportunity to create a simple website, which involved the usage of HTML and CSS. At that point I started applying for more projects and began seeking for more opportunities in the field. That is how I ended up participating in two amazing internships, where I learnt a wealth of valuable skills and obtained vital experience. Today, I work as a freelance frontend engineer, designing and developing websites for local as well as foreign businesses.

Even when I finish my work, I always tend to continue coding and learning something new on my own. Most recently I have started learning ReactJs. In my spare time I play violin and I find a beautiful crossover between software and music. Both pursue challenges in many aspects of our mind: problem solving, creativity, organization and so on. This is what keeps me up at night, a never ending thirst to create gorgeous and powerful things and share them with the world!

Hard Skills: HTML, CSS/SASS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Git, Github
